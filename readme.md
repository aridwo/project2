Description of the project (2-3+ sentences):
This project is an XKCD generator -- which creates a password that is easy to remember, but hard to forget. People often make difficult passwords by doing things like interchanging a zero and the letter “o” or coming up with words we can’t even spell, which is hard to remember and just as easy for a computer to crack as any other word of the same length. It is, in fact, better to have a long password of random words. So, for this project, I did just that by giving visitors the option to create their own XKCD-style password that is customizable from 1-5 words, with the option to include a symbol and/or number if they choose.
